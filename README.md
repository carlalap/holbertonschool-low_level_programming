Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

0x00. C - Hello, World \n,
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while \n
0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
0x07. C - Recursion
0x08. C - Static libraries
0x09. C - argc, argv
0x0A. C - malloc, free
0x0B. C - More malloc, free
0x0C. C - Preprocessor
0x0D. C - Structures, typedef
0x0E. C - Function pointers
0x0F. C - Variadic functions
0x10. C - printf
0x11. C - Singly linked lists
0x12. C - More singly linked lists
0x13. C - Bit manipulation
0x14. C - File I/O
0x15. C - Simple Shell
0x16. C - Doubly linked lists
0x17. C - Dynamic libraries
0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
0x19. C - Hash tables
0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
0x1B. C - Makefiles
0x1C. C - Binary trees
0x1D. C - Search Algorithms
